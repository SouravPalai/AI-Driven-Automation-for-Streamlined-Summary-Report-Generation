  "Before using this template for authoring, refer to the supplemental instructions on Find-IT. This template is used for ALL Interventional studies that evaluate the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of a GSK product.\nMaster Disclosure Document (MDD) serves as the source document to disclose protocol related information across different clinical trial registers (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Information System (EU CTIS) and/or GSK/ViiV Clinical Study Register) as required by external regulations and/or GSK policy. Check in TMF for the latest version of the template before initiating a new MDD. As information from the approved MDD will be disclosed on publicly available clinical trial register(s) as required by applicable regulations and GSK policy, minimize inclusion of information that may be considered commercially confidential.": "The key design elements of this protocol and results summaries will be posted on www.ClinicalTrials.gov and/or GSK Clinical Study Register in compliance with applicable regulations/GSK policy.
